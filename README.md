# SimpleGAS

A SimpleGAS is a set of tutorials for entry-level Unreal Engine enthusiasts who wants to leverage the power of the Gameplay Ability System in their prototypes. While there are great tutorials and GitHub repositories which cover the topic of GAS in more depth, this tutorial is requiring a minimum C++ setup and showcases working examples built entirely using Blueprints. This tutorial is for those who are new to Unreal Engine gameplay/multiplayer development or simply need an easy headstart before diving into more sophisticated GAS-related content.
